# Matrix-Multiplication-Multi-Threads
This project is used to compare 3 different methods to perform matrix multiplication according to time in milliseconds. <br />
The three methood: <br />
  1.Normal multiplication (thread for whole matrix). <br />
  2.Creating threads to calculate each row (thread for each row). <br />
  3.Creating threads to calculate a single number (thread for each number). <br />
The code can be run by a make file.
