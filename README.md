# Matrix-Multiplication-Multi-Threads
This project is used to compare 3 different methods to perform matrix multiplication according to time in milliseconds.
The three methood:
  1.Normal multiplication (thread for whole matrix).
  2.Creating threads to calculate each row (thread for each row).
  3.Creating threads to calculate a single number (thread for each number).
The code can be run by a make file.
